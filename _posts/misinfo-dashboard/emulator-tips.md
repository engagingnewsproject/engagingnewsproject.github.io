## Emulator Tips:

The Firebase Emulator should boot up and provide you an emulator link (look for `View Emulator UI at` in your command line output). 

Open that link to view the Emulator UI:

![emulator-ui](https://media.github.austin.utexas.edu/user/3619/files/1012c2ee-b9b2-4529-8914-2e0455af9bda)

**See Emulator Tips** for more info.

### Add yourself as a user via the "Emulator Authentication" tab. 

#### Two options:

1. Option one: Manually add yourself

   From the Firebase Emulator UI select the "Emulator Authentication" tab and click "Add user". Only required fields are: `name`, `email` and `password`. Change your role? see _Available user roles_ below.

2. Option two: Sign up.

   You can also signup like a normal user at the Login/Signup page. Once you have signed up:

    - Open the link printed out in your Emulator terminal window. 
      - **_all you need to do is open the link._ Once you've opened the link close the tab and...
    - Return to your initial Signup tab and login with the credentials you signed up with. Change your role? see _Available user roles_ below.

#### Available user roles:

- *General User:*
    
    No additional configuration required.
    
- *Agency User:*

    In the "Custom Claims" input enter `{"agency":true}` & save.

- *Admin User:*

    In the "Custom Claims" input enter `{"admin":true}` & save.
    

#### Emulator UI
- Database: find the imported database under the Emulator UI / Firestore tab.
- Users: view, add, edit & delete users under the Authentication tab.
- Files & Uploads: Storage tab in the Emulator UI.

#### Users

Your user UID that you created will not be associated with any reports or agencies so you can either add reports via the Misinfo Dashboard in your localhost:3000 window or go into the Emulator UI and manually change the `userID` to your own for some reports. Same idea with assigning your user to an agency: go into the Emulator UI and add your email to an agency's `agencyUsers` field.

#### Emulator log files

Emulator creates log files (`firebase-debug.log` & `ui-debug.log`) when you boot up the emulator. No need to push those with git. 

#### Export your local emulator data

The Firebase emulator allows you to export data from your running emulator instance. If you want to stash a baseline set of data, auth profiles you have set up in your running emulator instance.

`firebase emulators:export ./emulator-data`

This command will export the running emulator instance's auth profiles, firestore data and storage files to the `/emulator-data` folder. **Recommended** to not commit the `/emulator-data` changed files as to not alter the baseline Emulator data.
