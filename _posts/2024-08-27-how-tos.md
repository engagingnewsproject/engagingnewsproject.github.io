# Node & NPM

### Step 1: Check Node.js and npm Versions

Before setting up the local installation of our WordPress site, it's important to ensure you have the correct versions of Node.js and npm installed.

1. **Open your terminal** (Command Prompt, Git Bash, or any terminal emulator you're comfortable with).

2. **Check the Node.js version**:
   - Run the following command to check your Node.js version:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - You should see an output that looks something like this:
     ```
     v14.x.x
     ```
   - Ensure that your version is **v14.x.x** or higher. If not, you may need to update Node.js.

3. **Check the npm version**:
   - Run the following command to check your npm version:
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```
   - You should see an output like:
     ```
     6.x.x
     ```
   - Ensure that your version is **6.x.x** or higher. If not, you may need to update npm.

### Step 2: Updating Node.js and npm (if necessary)

If you need to update Node.js or npm, follow these steps:

1. **For macOS/Linux users**: Use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager).
   - Install nvm if you don't have it installed:
     ```bash
     curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
     ```
   - Install the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js:
     ```bash
     nvm install --lts
     ```
   - Set it as the default version:
     ```bash
     nvm use --lts
     nvm alias default node
     ```

2. **For Windows users**: Use the [Node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install the latest version. 

3. **Verify the installation**: After updating, run `node -v` and `npm -v` again to ensure the versions are correct.
