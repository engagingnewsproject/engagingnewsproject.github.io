The Center for Media Engagement envisions a vibrant American media ecosystem that more effectively empowers the public to understand, appreciate, and participate in the democratic exchange of ideas.

We are a first-of-its-kind center that conducts original, groundbreaking research alongside newsrooms, social media platforms, and organizations looking to influence media practices for the benefit of democracy. We translate our theoretically driven and methodologically rigorous research into tools and strategies that these same stakeholders and collaborators can employ for the greater good.

The Center for Media Engagement was officially founded in 2017, and existed since 2011 as the Engaging News Project with the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life. It is housed in the Moody College of Communication at The University of Texas at Austin. The Center consists of faculty, staff, post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers from The University of Texas and partner faculty from other universities across the country and around the world.

In a new approach to tackling societal divides, the Center for Media Engagement launched the method of connective democracy. Connective democracy unites newsrooms, scholars, platforms, and policymakers in a methodical approach toward bridging gaps in our society. The center will spend the next several years working on a vision to promote connective democracy.
